<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ashlely Smith, I am a single mother of two beautiful girls age 2 and age 9. I come from a semi big <br>
   family. I am 6 of 7 children so I learned what not to do based off of what the older 5 did. My family is very <br>
   close and very supportive of one another. My parents installed the foundation of love in us. 
</p>

<p>My work life started at age 14 in a pizza shop. My working experience continued to bounce around helping me  <br>
   to learn many helpful skills. I completed high school obtaining a Diploma. Right after high school I completed <br>
   medical school, where I took up Medical Assistant as my study. I then worked in that field for about two years. <br>
   My school life after that has been touch and go with online courses and certificates to continue my learning. </p>

<p>Things I love to do for fun are pretty much be a mom and travel. I don't feel like I have a specific hobby   <br>
   I really just enjoy whatever I envolve myself in. My goal in life to give my girls the steps and tools to    <br>
   have the foundation of financial freedom. I also want to continue to travel more and become successful in my <br>
   software engineering field.</p>
